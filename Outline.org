* Patch Parser
  - Aeson
  - Patch {op :: Text, path :: Text, from :: Maybe Text, value :: Maybe Text} deriving (Data, Typeable)
* Data Parser
  - Aeson
  - Traverse the AST or use a heterogenous list type?
  - Heterogenous list should probably get turned into a tree
    - Manually traverse the tree or turn it into a Map instead?
* Data Transformer
  - MapPatch
    - Already Implemented
  - TreePatch
    - Need to implement
* Writing Changes
  - I think Aeson has a thing for converting from data to JSON text
